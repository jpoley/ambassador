# This image has the toolchains we need to actually build Ambassador, plus
# the Python dependencies that Ambassador actually needs. It's used as a
# base image in the main Dockerfile, so that we can use the Docker cache
# to more effectively dodge network issues with APK repos or the Cheese
# Shop.
#
# If you have to change this - including changing Ambassador's dependency
# graph, including multi! - you _must_ update AMBASSADOR_DOCKER_IMAGE_CACHED
# in the Makefile, then run "make docker-update-base" to build and push the
# new image.
